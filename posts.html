                <p>Today is the first day of my new life. I have my website set up, there's a laid out course in front of me,
                  and the only thing between success and myself is the amount of time it will take me to become confident in my ability
                  to problem solve with my code. So here I go, intro to front-end development!

                <p> I'm proud to say after a month of working full-time, being a full-time parent, and studying 20 hours week in web develoment, 
                  I have officially filled half of my composition notebook with notes of the concepts/codes that I've learned. I feel like I've barely 
                  scratched the surface and sometimes I feel like I could never learn it all but that's the fun of it. Knowing there are so many paths
                  to take the reach the same destination really makes you feel like you have the option of choice, something each person wants in their life.
